# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike 

## Overview
The CitiBike Analysis story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14Challenge_16594058840770/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 

The drive for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for investors with the data provided. This analysis used New York City as the main frame of data, it is intneded to provide visualization for key factors to identify areas of opporunity for launching a bikehsharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

These were the main questions essential for visualiation for investors:  
1. Who uses bikeshare programs?
2. What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
3. What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
4. How much are the bikes used and by whom?

##Results

###NYC CitiBike Customer Description 

![Customer and Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102635884/184520200-1eb6752a-0269-4e06-aeca-4a3700f87ccd.PNG)

Undertanding user demographics is essential in understanding who will be subcribing to a bikisharing prgram. Tweo factors in dempographics that were accessible through the CitiBike day was Gender and User Type. In the pie charts below, investors would be able to identify that roughly 2/3 of the customer group in NYC were Subscriibers, which shows that more people were willing to regularly use the bike sharing program.  For gender, roughly 2/3 of the group were main, showcaseing that currently the bike sharing program has a larger pull from the bikesharing program.

### NYC CitiBike Trip Duration

Through this lien graph an investor is able to idenitfy that the number of trips by durations had a larger prorpotion of customers using the bikes for less than an hour in lenth. More bike rides were saround a half hour or less. This means that customers most likely traveling short distances. 

### NYC CitiBike Trip Duration by Gender

Similar to the pie chart showing customer usuage by gender, this line grapgh compares trip duration by gender. This grapgh shows that both genders utilized the CitiBikes for less than an hour and neither of the three groups used it more than the other despite the significant customer gender difference.

### NYC CitiBike Peak Use Hours

This heatmap can provide a visualization for weekly usage patterns to identify hours in a day where there is a higher usage in the program. The heaviest bike usage is around typical commuting times Monday through Friday. These time are most frequent around 6am-9am and then again from 4pm-7pm. During the weekends Saturdays saw consistent high usage between the hour of 9am to 7pm which can combine with the evenings where tourst and locals would use the bikes to avoid the traffic in the streets. Additonally, a low usage point is Wednesday evenings where you do not see high usage like you would the other Weekdays. It would be worth exploring this time to see what drives this abdnoramality.

### NYC Citibike Trips by Gender, Weekday, Gender

While the last line chart showed us that the duration of most drips were less than an hour by length this next graph shows the times of the day where each gender group uses the bikes the most. Through this analysis, for females eveb with the small usuage by this group, there is no obvious differnce in the times of day that it us used. There is a higher usuage around commuting times but it is not drastically significant of a differnce. For the males, there is a difference based off the heatmap on the times of high usuage. This can be used to confirm that a majority of males using the bike sharing program use it for their commutes, which is most likely within a half hour time span as suggested by the chart above. 

### NYC CitiBike Trips by User Type/Gender/Day

This last heatmap provides a high level view of the weekday usuage by Gender. This furthur exemplifies that the male user group uses the bikesharing program the most. It also highlights the consistent use of the male user group everyday of the week. While the female group still shows the same consistency, it is not to the same degree that the male groups has due to the lower count of this user group. 

### NYC CitiBike Top Starting and Ending Trip Locations

These map images showcase what would most likely be expected from a large city population. NYC is a large tourist and commuting city, which as expected a large majority of their starting and ending locations are within the main island. There is basically no differnce in the usage locations from start to finish, which means that a majority of these bikes will not travel outside of these areas frequently which will be a easy win when it comes to repairs and avilaiblity of bikes. 


## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in large metropolitan areas. Factors supporting usuage casn be driven by areas where real estate is densely packed, high traffic, and insufficeent parking space. A large proportion of customers are subscribers and of this group a large majorty are also males. One thing to note is if this bike sharing program was to expand to Des Moines, to earn subsribers takes time and a new bike sharing program will need to understand it's areas of oppotunity, such as appealing to a smaller user group like the female group in NYC and encoraging them to become subscribers. While bike usuage is a pull for males, it will be a push strategy for the female demographic. Peak period of these bikes was typically Monday through Friday at commuting times and for the weekends, usuage was consistent for a majority of the day.

This analysis cenetered heavily around times of usage and gender groups. Additional visualiations that could play a role in understanding bike sharing programs is understanding the areas outside of the main metropolitan area. The reason for this is because there is still signiciant usage outside of the island area. A way to capture this is to use the starting and ending locations with map points to investigate what proportion of users outside these areas do use this program and see if there is opporuntity to provide more bike availability. 

Additonally, another visualation could be to investigate what areas locals and tourist visit the most and how long these trip durations are. While this could require addtional data pull, it can be used with existing data to compare the trip duration and locations for customers compared to subscribers.
